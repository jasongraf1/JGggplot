\title{Violin plots of Continuous Variable with ggplot2}
\usage{
ggViolin.plot(data, x, y, facet = NULL, fill.col = NULL,
	facet.cols = NULL, scales = "fixed", CI = .5)
}
\description{
Create violin plot of data with interior bars representing median and 50% CI.
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{ a dataframe }
\item{x}{ a character vector containing the name of the column in \code{data} containing factor whose levels will be plotted on the x-axis. }
\item{y}{ a character vector containing the name of the column in \code{data} containing numeric vector whose values will be represented by the boxes. }
\item{facet}{ character vector containing name(s) of one or two additional factors in \code{data} by which the plot will be faceted. }
\item{fill.col}{ a character vector specifying the color of the boxes. Default is gray. }
\item{facet.cols}{ numeric. Number of columns in display of faceted plots. }
\item{scales}{ character vector specifying whether scales should be fixed across facets. Values are "fixed", or "free". }
\item{CI}{ numeric. Confidence interval to be plotted as bars inside violin plots. Must be value between 0 and 1. }
\item{\dots}{ additional options. }
